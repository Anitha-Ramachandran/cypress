<h2> Description of Each Folder Structure</h2>

cypress: This is the root folder for Cypress.
fixtures: This folder contains fixture files (e.g., mock data) that can be used in tests.
integration: This folder contains your test files organized by feature or functionality. Each folder represents a specific feature, and within each folder, you have your test spec file(s) written in TypeScript.
plugins: This folder contains your Cypress plugins, such as custom commands or custom configurations.
support: This folder contains support files for your test suite, including custom Cypress commands and any other initialization or configuration files.
utils: This folder contains utility files that can be reused across your tests, such as helper functions or reusable modules.
pages: This folder contains your Page Object Model (POM) files, which represent the different pages or components of your web application. Each file represents a specific page/component and contains methods to interact with the elements on that page/component.
reports: This folder can be used to store test execution reports generated by tools like Mochawesome or Allure.
screenshots: This folder can be used to store screenshots captured during test execution for debugging purposes.
videos: This folder can be used to store video recordings of test executions, if needed.
tsconfig.json: This file contains TypeScript configuration options for your project.
Please note that this is just one example of a folder structure, and you can adapt it to suit your specific needs or preferences.
